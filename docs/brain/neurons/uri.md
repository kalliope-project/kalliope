## Synapses example

Simple call to a server. The default method is GET

```yaml
- name: "test-get-url"
  signals:
    - order: "test-get-url"
  neurons:
    - uri:
        url: "http://host.domain/get/1"
```

A simple call with authentication

```yaml
- name: "test-get-url-with-auth"
    signals:
      - order: "test-get-url-with-auth"
    neurons:
      - uri:
          url: "http://host.domain/get/1"
          user: "admin"
          password: "secret"
```

A simple post with data inside the url

```yaml
- name: "test-post-url-with-auth"
    signals:
      - order: "test-post-url-with-data"
    neurons:
      - uri:
          url: "http://host.domain/login?email=user@host.domain&password=foobar123"
          method: POST
```

A post with json data. Note that we need to escape quotes from the payload.

```yaml
- name: "test-post-url"
    signals:
      - order: "test-post-url"
    neurons:
      - uri:
          url: "http://host.domain/posts"
          method: POST
          headers:
            Content-Type: 'application/json'
          data: "{\"id\": 1,\"title\": \"foo\", \"body\": \"bar\", \"userId\": 1}"
```

A post with json data imported from a file and a custom header.

```yaml
- name: "test-post-url"
    signals:
      - order: "test-post-url"
    neurons:
      - uri:
          url: "http://host.domain/posts"
          method: POST
          headers:
            Content-Type: 'application/json'
            user-agent: 'my-app/0.0.1'
          data_from_file: "/path/to/my/payload.json"
```

And the `payload.json` would be (note that we don't need to escape any character):

```json
{ "title": "foo", "body": "bar", "userId": 1 }
```

A simple call to a deletion. Here we also ask Kalliope to tell use if request was a success through a template, depending on the returned status code.

```yaml
- name: "test-delete-url"
  signals:
    - order: "test-delete-url"
  neurons:
    - uri:
        url: "http://host.domain/posts/1"
        method: DELETE
        say_template:
          - "{% if status_code==201 %}delete complete{% else %}fail to delete{% endif %}"
```

Call to an URL to get a resource and make kalliope speak out loud a value of returned content.
Here, we ask the server to return us the user with ID number 42. We know that the server will return a dict like the following

```json
{
  "id": 42,
  "name": "Leanne Graham",
  "username": "Bret",
  "email": "Sincere@april.biz",
  "phone": "1-770-736-8031 x56442",
  "website": "hildegard.org",
  "company": {
    "name": "Romaguera-Crona",
    "catchPhrase": "Multi-layered client-server neural-net",
    "bs": "harness real-time e-markets"
  }
}
```

Here is the synapse we would use to make Kalliope speak out loud the name of the user and the name of his company

```yaml
- name: "test-get-url-with-template"
  signals:
    - order: "test-get-url-with-template"
  neurons:
    - uri:
        url: "http://host.domain/users/42"
        say_template:
          - "The user name is {{ content.name }} and his company's name is {{ content.company.name }}"
```

## Templates example

The following template will make kalliope read the content of the received json variable "title" from the remote server.

```jinja2
The title is {{ content.title }}
```

The following template will make Kalliope say if the request has been made with success or not depending on the returned status code.

```jinja2
{% if status_code==200 %}request complete{% else %}request failled{% endif %}
```

## Notes

> When the parameter `data` is used, you need to escape character that could be interpreted by the YAML syntax.
