As files are written on YAML syntax, we strongly recommend you to use an editor(IDE) like VS Code or Atom . If you are using kalliope from a Rpi, the idea would be to configure your assistant from your main computer with an IDE and then push your config folder into your Rpi. When you start kalliope using the CLI ( kalliope start ), the program will try to load your settings.yml and brain.yml in the following order: From your current folder, E.g /home/pi/my_kalliope/ From /etc/kalliope/ From the default settings.yml and brain.yml which are located in the root of the Kalliope project tree. This is a common tree of a Kalliope configuration folder: kalliope_config / \u251c\u2500\u2500 brains \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 included_brain . yml \u251c\u2500\u2500 brain . yml \u251c\u2500\u2500 files \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 kalliope - EN - 13 samples . pmdl \u2514\u2500\u2500 settings . yml We made starter kits that only needs to be cloned, placed into the Rpi and launched. You'll find the whole list of available start kits on the Kalliope's website . Those repositories provide you a structure to start playing and learning basics of Kalliope. Download the starter kit of your choice and open the folder with your IDE. All files are expressed in YAML format (see YAML Syntax ) and has a minimum of syntax, which intentionally tries to not be a programming language or script, but rather a model of a configuration or a process. Let's open the main brain file of the English starter kit. You'll see there are some included sub brains file. - includes : - brains/say.yml If you open the say.yml file from the brains folder, you'll see a basic synapse that uses the neuron \" Say \" and make Kalliope speaks out loud \"Hello sir\" when you say \"hello\". - name : \"say-hello-en\" signals : - order : \"Hello\" neurons : - say : message : \"Hello sir\" Let's break this down in sections so we can understand how the file is built and what each part means. Items that begin with a - are considered as list items. Items have the format of key: value where value can be a simple string or a sequence of other items. At the top level we have a \"name\" tag. This is the unique identifier of the synapse. It must be an unique word with the only accepted values : alphanumerics and dash. ([a - zA - Z0 - 9-]) - name : \"Say-hello\" The first part, called signals is a list of input actions. You can add as many signal as you want in the \"signals\" section. If one of them is triggered, the neuron list will be executed. signals : - order : \"say-hello\" In the following example, we use just one signal, an \"order\", but it an can be: an order: Something that has been spoke out loud by the user. an event: A date or a frequency (E.G: repeat each morning at 8:30) a mqtt message A message received on a MQTT topic a geolocation From the position of your smartphone a community signal E.g: GPIO signal allow you to trigger actions from a button No signal . Then the synapse can be only called from another synapse or by the API Then we have the neurons declaration. Neurons are modules that will be executed when the input action(signal) is triggered. You can define as many neurons as you want to the same input action (for example: say something, then do something etc...). This declaration contains a list (because it starts with a \"-\") of neurons neurons : - neuron_1_name - neuron_2_name - another_neuron The order of execution of neurons is defined by the order in which they are listed in neurons declaration. Some neurons need parameters that can be passed as arguments following the syntax bellow: neurons : - neuron_name : parameter1 : \"value1\" parameter2 : \"value2\" Note here that parameters are indented with one tabulation bellow the neuron's name (YAML syntax requirement). In this example, the neuron called \"say\" will make Kalliope speak out loud the sentence in parameter message . Neurons can be Core (installed by default) or community based (need to be installed). Time to start Kalliope. Move into the folder and then start Kalliope: cd /path/to/the/starter_kit kalliope start Note: Do not start Kalliope as root user or with sudo Kalliope will load settings and brain, the output should looks the following Starting event manager Events loaded Starting Kalliope Press Ctrl+C for stopping Starting REST API Listening port: 5000 Waiting for trigger detection Then speak the hotwork out loud to wake up Kalliope (with the right pronunciation depending on your starter kit. \"Kalliop\u00e9\" in french, \"Kalliopee\" in English, etc..). If the trigger is successfully raised, you'll see \"say something\" into the console. Say something! Then you can say \"hello\" and listen the Kalliope response. Say something!

Fortunately, the API provides a way to continue interaction with Kalliope and still use neurotransmitter neurons while doing API calls. When you start a synapse via its name or an order (like shown above), the answer of the API call will tell you in the response that kalliope is waiting for a response via the \"status\" return. Status can either by complete (nothing else to do) or waiting_for_answer , in which case Kalliope is waiting for your response :). In this case, you can launch another order containing your response. Let's take as an example the simple neurotransmitter brain of the EN starter kit : First step is to fire the \"ask me a question order\": curl -i \\ --user admin:secret \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -X POST \\ -d '{\"order\":\"ask me a question\"}' \\ http://localhost:5000/synapses/start/order The response should be as follow: { \"matched_synapses\" : [ { \"matched_order\" : \"ask me a question\" , \"neuron_module_list\" : [ { \"generated_message\" : \"do you like french fries?\" , \"neuron_name\" : \"Say\" } ], \"synapse_name\" : \"synapse1\" } ], \"status\" : \"waiting_for_answer\" , \"user_order\" : \"ask me a question\" } The \"status\": \"waiting_for_answer\" indicates that it waits for a response, so let's send it: curl -i \\ --user admin:secret \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -X POST \\ -d '{\"order\":\"not at all\"}' \\ http://localhost:5000/synapses/start/order { \"matched_synapses\" : [ { \"matched_order\" : \"ask me a question\" , \"neuron_module_list\" : [ { \"generated_message\" : \"do you like french fries?\" , \"neuron_name\" : \"Say\" }, { \"generated_message\" : null , \"neuron_name\" : \"Neurotransmitter\" } ], \"synapse_name\" : \"synapse1\" }, { \"matched_order\" : \"not at all\" , \"neuron_module_list\" : [ { \"generated_message\" : \"You don't like french fries.\" , \"neuron_name\" : \"Say\" } ], \"synapse_name\" : \"synapse3\" } ], \"status\" : \"complete\" , \"user_order\" : null } And now the status is complete. This works also when you have nested neurotransmitter neurons, you just need to keep monitoring the status from the API answer.","title":"Synapses"},{"location":"api/synapses/#kalliope-api-synapses","text":"Method URL Action GET / Get kaliope version GET /synapses List synapses POST /synapses Add a synapse to the brain DELETE /synapses Delete a synapse by name GET /synapses/ Get synapse details by name POST /synapses/start/id/ Run a synapse by its name POST /synapses/start/order Run a synapse from a text order POST /synapses/start/audio Run a synapse from an audio sample","title":"Kalliope API: Synapses"},{"location":"api/synapses/#list-synapses","text":"Normal response codes: 200 Error response codes: unauthorized(401), itemNotFound(404) Curl command: curl -i \\ --user admin:secret \\ -X GET \\ http://localhost:5000/synapses Output example: { \"synapses\" : [ [ { \"name\" : \"stop-kalliope\" , \"neurons\" : [ { \"say\" : { \"message\" : \"Good bye\" } }, \"kill_switch\" ], \"signals\" : [ { \"order\" : \"close\" } ] } ], [ { \"name\" : \"say-hello\" , \"neurons\" : [ { \"say\" : { \"message\" : [ \"Bonjour monsieur\" ] } } ], \"signals\" : [ { \"order\" : \"bonjour\" } ] } ] ] }","title":"List synapses"},{"location":"api/synapses/#show-synapse-details","text":"Normal response codes: 200 Error response codes: unauthorized(401), itemNotFound(404) Curl command: curl -i \\ --user admin:secret \\ -X GET \\ http://localhost:5000/synapses/say-hello Output example: { \"synapses\" : { \"name\" : \"say-hello\" , \"neurons\" : [ { \"say\" : { \"message\" : [ \"Bonjour monsieur\" ] } } ], \"signals\" : [ { \"order\" : \"bonjour\" } ] } }","title":"Show synapse details"},{"location":"api/synapses/#add-a-synapse-to-the-brain","text":"Normal response codes: 201 Error response codes: unauthorized(401), itemNotFound(404) Curl command: curl -i -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ --user admin:secret \\ -X POST \\ -d '{ \"name\": \"Say-hello\", \"signals\": [ { \"order\": \"I am Batman\" } ], \"neurons\": [ { \"say\": { \"message\": \"I know\" } } ] }' \\ http://127.0.0.1:5000/synapses Output example: { \"enabled\" : true , \"name\" : \"Say-hello\" , \"neurons\" : [ { \"name\" : \"say\" , \"parameters\" : { \"message\" : \"I know\" } } ], \"signals\" : [ { \"name\" : \"order\" , \"parameters\" : \"I am Batman\" } ] }","title":"Add a synapse to the brain"},{"location":"api/synapses/#delete-a-synapse-by-its-name","text":"Normal response codes: 204 Error response codes: unauthorized(401), itemNotFound(404) Curl command: curl -i \\ --user admin:secret \\ -X DELETE \\ http://localhost:5000/synapses/start/id/say-hello","title":"Delete a synapse by its name"},{"location":"api/synapses/#run-a-synapse-by-its-name","text":"Normal response codes: 201 Error response codes: unauthorized(401), itemNotFound(404) Curl command: curl -i \\ --user admin:secret \\ -X POST \\ http://127.0.0.1:5000/synapses/say-hello-en The mute flag can be added to this call.

Fortunately, the API provides a way to continue interaction with Kalliope and still use neurotransmitter neurons while doing API calls. When you start a synapse via its name or an order (like shown above), the answer of the API call will tell you in the response that kalliope is waiting for a response via the \"status\" return. Status can either by complete (nothing else to do) or waiting_for_answer , in which case Kalliope is waiting for your response :). In this case, you can launch another order containing your response. Let's take as an example the simple neurotransmitter brain of the EN starter kit : First step is to fire the \"ask me a question order\": curl -i \\ --user admin:secret \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -X POST \\ -d '{\"order\":\"ask me a question\"}' \\ http://localhost:5000/synapses/start/order The response should be as follow: { \"matched_synapses\" : [ { \"matched_order\" : \"ask me a question\" , \"neuron_module_list\" : [ { \"generated_message\" : \"do you like french fries?\" , \"neuron_name\" : \"Say\" } ], \"synapse_name\" : \"synapse1\" } ], \"status\" : \"waiting_for_answer\" , \"user_order\" : \"ask me a question\" } The \"status\": \"waiting_for_answer\" indicates that it waits for a response, so let's send it: curl -i \\ --user admin:secret \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -X POST \\ -d '{\"order\":\"not at all\"}' \\ http://localhost:5000/synapses/start/order { \"matched_synapses\" : [ { \"matched_order\" : \"ask me a question\" , \"neuron_module_list\" : [ { \"generated_message\" : \"do you like french fries?\" , \"neuron_name\" : \"Say\" }, { \"generated_message\" : null , \"neuron_name\" : \"Neurotransmitter\" } ], \"synapse_name\" : \"synapse1\" }, { \"matched_order\" : \"not at all\" , \"neuron_module_list\" : [ { \"generated_message\" : \"You don't like french fries.\" , \"neuron_name\" : \"Say\" } ], \"synapse_name\" : \"synapse3\" } ], \"status\" : \"complete\" , \"user_order\" : null } And now the status is complete.

It's a module that gives a configuration of your own personal assistant and, so, determines it's behavior and fonctionnalities. Kalliope will look for the brain in the order bellow: From you current folder, E.g /home/pi/my_kalliope/brain.yml From /etc/kalliope/brain.yml From the default brain.yml located in the root of the project tree. Brain is composed by synapses : a synapse is the link between input( signals ) and output actions( neurons ). Signals Syntax A signal is an input event triggered by a synapse. When a signal from the list is caught, Kalliope runs attached neurons of the synapse. The syntax is the following signals : - signal_name : parameter Or signals : - signal_name : parameter_key1 : parameter_value1 parameter_key2 : parameter_value2 Example: signals : - order : \"hello kalliope\" signals : - event : hour : \"8\" minute : \"30\" You can also set an empty list as signals. This means that the synapse can only be started from the CLI, the API, a hook or from another synapse. signals : [] Output parameters Some signals will send a list of parameters to all neurons when triggered. Neurons are then free to use them or not. For example, the signal mqtt_subscriber(signals/mqtt_subscriber.md) send a variable called \"mqtt_subscriber_message\" when triggered. In the example bellow, the neuron \"say\" use this variable to make Kalliope speak out loud a status received from the MQTT broker. E.g - name : \"mqtt\" signals : - mqtt_subscriber : # this signal send a \"mqtt_subscriber_message\" when triggered broker_ip : \"127.0.0.1\" topic : \"topic1\" neurons : - say : message : - \"The light is now {{ mqtt_subscriber_message }}\" Available signals Here is a list of core signal that are installed natively with Kalliope Name Description event Launch synapses periodically at fixed times, dates, or intervals. mqtt_subscriber Launch synapse from when receive a message from a MQTT broker order Launch synapses from captured vocal order from the microphone geolocation Define synapses to be triggered by clients handling geolocation See the full list of core and community signals on the Kalliope's website . Neurons A neuron is a plugin that performs a specific action. You use it to create a synapse. You can add as many neurons as you want to a synapse. The neurons are executed one by one when one of the input signal is triggered. Syntax Neurons are declared in the neurons section of a synapse in your brain file. The neurons section is a list (because it starts with a \"-\") which contains neuron modules names neurons : - neuron_1_name - neuron_2_name - another_neuron Some neurons need parameters that can be passed as arguments following the syntax bellow: neurons : - neuron_name : parameter1 : \"value1\" parameter2 : \"value2\" Eg: note: parameters are indented with two spaces bellow the neuron's name following the YAML syntax. note: Kalliope will try to load the neuron from your resources directory, then from core neuron packages. Input values Neurons require some parameters from the synapse declaration to work. Those parameters, also called arguments, can be passed to the neuron from: the neuron declaration global variables the captured order output parameter from a signal kalliope memory From the neuron declaration: neurons : - neuron_name : parameter1 : \"value1\" parameter2 : \"value2\" From global variables: (cf: settings ) - name : \"run-simple-sleep\" signals : - order : \"Wait for me \" neurons : - sleep : seconds : {{ variable }} From the captured order: - name : \"say-hello\" signals : - order : \"say hello to {{ name }}\" neurons : - say : message : - \"Hello {{ name }}\" Here, the spoken value captured by the TTS engine will be passed as an argument to the neuron in every parameters that want use it. Example, with the synapse declaration above, if you say \"say hello to Bob\". The parameter message is instantiated and all {{ name }} are replaced by \"bob\". From parameters sent by a signal(E.g, mqtt subscriber) - name : \"mqtt\" signals : - mqtt_subscriber : # this signal send a \"mqtt_subscriber_message\" when triggered broker_ip : \"127.0.0.1\" topic : \"topic1\" neurons : - say : message : - \"The light is now {{ mqtt_subscriber_message }}\" Note: If a parameter of a neuron is waiting for a variable from the order and this variable haven't been found in the spoken order, then the neuron is not launched. Output values Some neurons will return variables into a dictionary of value. Those values can be used to make your own Kalliope answer through a template. The objective of using a template is to let the user choosing what he wants to make Kalliope saying in its own language. A template is a text file that contains variables , which get replaced with values when the template is evaluated by the template engine , and tags , which control the logic of the template. The template engine used in Kalliope is Jinja2 . For example, if we look at the documentation of the neuron systemedate , we can see that the neuron will return a dictionary of value like minute , hours and all other values about the current time on the system where Kalliope is installed. A simple, that only use variables , template would be It is {{ hours }} and {{ minutes }} minutes. Placed in a complete synapse, it looks like the following - name : \"time\" signals : - order : \"what time is it\" neurons : - systemdate : say_template : - \"It is {{ hours }} hours and {{ minutes }} minutes\" Here, we use variables from the neuron into our template file. Both variables will be interpreted by the template engine. So, what the user will hear is something like It is 9 hours and 21 minutes . We can add some logic to a template with tags. Here a simple example with a test tag , that will make Kalliope change the pronounced sentence depending on the current time. { % if hours > 8 % } It is late , isn ' t it? { % else % } We still have time { % endif % } As this is multi-lines, we can put the content in a file and use a file_template instead of a say_template for more clarity. - name : \"time\" signals : - order : \"what time is it\" neurons : - systemdate : file_template : /path/to/file/template.j2 kalliope_memory Kalliope can store in a short term memory a variable from an order or generated from a neuron: - output parameters from a neuron - variable parameters captured from an order. Stored parameters can then be used in other synapses during a future call. Please not that this memory is not preserved after a restart of Kalliope. Store parameters generated by a neuron Syntax with output parameters from a neuron - name : \"synapse-name\" signals : - order : \"my order\" neurons : - neuron_name : kalliope_memory : key_name_in_memory : \"{{ output_variable_from_neuron }}\" other_key_name_in_memory : \"{{ other_output_variable_from_neuron }}\" Syntax to reuse memorized parameters in another synapse - name : \"synapse-name\" signals : - order : \"an order\" neurons : - neuron_name : parameter1 : \"{{ kalliope_memory['key_name_in_memory'] }}\" parameter2 : \"{{ kalliope_memory['other_key_name_in_memory'] }}\" Note: The key name need to be placed into simple quotes Example with a core neuron like systemdate - name : \"synapse-name\" signals : - order : \"my order\" neurons : - systemdate : say_template : - \"It' {{ hours }} hours and {{ minutes }} minutes\" kalliope_memory : hours_when_asked : \"{{ hours }}\" minutes_when_asked : \"{{ minutes }}\" Here, the systemdate neuron generates variables that haven been passed to the template like described in the previous section and to the memory of Kalliope. Those parameters can now be used in a next call - name : \"synapse-name-2\" signals : - order : \"a what time I've asked the time?\" neurons : - say : message : - \"at {{ kalliope_memory['hours_when_asked']}} hours and {{ kalliope_memory['minutes_when_asked']}} minutes\" As it's based on a template, the value can be modified by adding a string kalliope_memory : my_saved_key : \"{{ neuron_parameter_name }} with a word\" Multiple parameters can be used and concatenated in the same memorized key kalliope_memory : my_saved_key : \"{{ neuron_parameter_name1 }} and {{ neuron_parameter_name2 }}\" Store parameters captured from orders Syntax - name : \"synapse-name\" signals : - order : \"my order with {{ variable }}\" neurons : - neuron_name : kalliope_memory : key_name_in_memory : \"{{ variable }}\" The syntax to reuse memorized parameters in another synapse is the same as the one used with neuron parameters - name : \"synapse-name\" signals : - order : \"an order\" neurons : - neuron_name : parameter1 : {{ kalliope_memory [ 'key_name_in_memory' ]}} Example - name : \"synapse-id\" signals : - order : \"say hello to {{ name }}\" neurons : - say : message : - \"Hello {{ name }}\" kalliope_memory : friend : \"{{ name }}\" Here, the variable \"name\" has been used directly into the template and also saved in memory behind the key \"friend\". The value can now be used in a next call like the following - name : \"synapse-id\" signals : - order : \"what is the name of my friend?\" neurons : - say : message : - \"It's {{ kalliope_memory['friend'] }} Here is another example brain whit use the neurotimer neuron. In this scenario, you want to remember to do something You: remind me to call mom in 15 minutes Kalliope: I'll notify you in 15 minutes 15 minutes later.. Kalliope: You asked me to remind you to call mom 15 minutes ago - name : \"remember-synapse\" signals : - order : \"remind me to {{ remember }} in {{ time }} minutes\" neurons : - neurotimer : seconds : \"{{ time }}\" synapse : \"remember-todo\" kalliope_memory : remember : \"{{ remember }}\" seconds : \"{{ time }}\" - say : message : - \"I'll remind you in {{ time }} minutes\" - name : \"remember-todo\" signals : {} neurons : - say : message : - \"You asked me to remind you to {{ kalliope_memory['remember'] }} {{ kalliope_memory['time'] }} minutes ago\" Get the last order generated TTS message Kalliope will save in memory automatically: - the last generated TTS message . - the last caught order To get the last generated message, use the key {{ kalliope_memory['kalliope_last_tts_message'] }} in your synapse. To get the last order, use the key {{ kalliope_memory['kalliope_last_order'] }} in your synapse. Keep in mind that the kalliope_last_tts_message variable is overridden every time Kalliope says something. So you need to catch messages you want to process in the right hook like on_start_speaking or on_stop_speaking . An example of usage is to send each message to an API each time Kalliope start speaking. You need at first to create a hook in your settings.yaml like the following hooks : on_start_speaking : \"mm-say\" Then create a synapse in your brain that is linked to the hook to send each message. As a concrete example, here the magic mirror neuron is used to send each spelt out loud message to the Magic Mirror API in order to show them on the screen. - name : \"mm-say\" signals : [] neurons : - magic_mirror : mm_url : \"http://127.0.0.1:8080/kalliope\" notification : \"KALLIOPE\" payload : \"{{ kalliope_memory['kalliope_last_tts_message'] }}\" Note kalliope_last_tts_message is overridden each time Kalliope says something. For example, a common practice is to have a synapse placed in the hook on_triggered in order to know when the hotword has been triggered. So, if this synapse is configured like the following - name : \"on-triggered-synapse\" signals : [] neurons : - say : message : \"what can i do for you?\" And you try the get the last generated message with a synapse like the following - name : \"last-message\" signals : - order : \"what was the last message?\" neurons : - say : message : \"it was {{ kalliope_memory['kalliope_last_tts_message'] }}\" Then the answer will always be \"it was what can i do for you?\" because the variable kalliope_last_tts_message has been overridden during the execution of the on-triggered-synapse . Split the brain If you want a better visibly, or simply sort your actions in different files, you can split the main brain file into multiple ones. To do that, use the import statement in the entry brain.yml file with the following syntax: - includes : - path/to/sub_brain.yml - path/to/another_sub_brain.yml E.g: - includes : - brains/rolling_shutter_commands.yml - brains/find_my_phone.yml Note: You can only use the include statement in the main brain file.

Input parameters parameter required default choices comment order YES The order is passed directly without any parameters Other way to write an order, with parameters: parameter required default choices comment text YES The order to match matching-type NO normal normal, strict, ordered-strict, not-contain Type of matching. See explanation bellow excluded-words only if not-contain The words which are present in the order to prevent other orders to be execute stt-correction NO List of words from the order to replace by other words stt-correction-file NO Same as stt-correction but load words from a YAML file Matching type You are not limited by the exact sentence you put in your order. Kalliope uses the matching, it means that you can pronounce the sentence which contains your order (so, can be much longer) and it will launch an attached task anyway. In this example, the task attached to order \"say hello\" will be launched even if you say \"say hello Kalliope\" \"Kalliope, say hello\" \"I want you to say hello\" \"i say goodbye you say hello\" \"whatever I say as long it contains say hello\" You must pay attention to define the orders as precise as possible. As Kalliope is based on matching, if you define your orders in different synapses too similiary, Kalliope risks to trigger more actions that you were expecting. For example, if you define two different synapses as shown below: - name : \"Say-hello\" signals : - order : \"say hello\" and - name : \"Say-something\" signals : - order : \"say\" When you will pronounce \"say hello\", it will trigger both synapses. To prevent this behavior, you can define a matching type for each order: normal : Will match if all words are present in the spoken order. strict : All word are present. No more word must be present in the spoken order. ordered-strict : All word are present, no more word and all word are in the same order as defined in the signal. not-contain : It will match only if all the words are present in the spoken order WITHOUT the excluded-words . - order : text : \"what is the weather\" matching-type : \"not-contain\" excluded-words : - \"in\" - \"at\" - \"on\" This way you can call for example \"whats the weather in Paris\" and the above synapse will not be execute. Order with arguments You can add one or more arguments to an order by adding bracket to the sentence. Syntax: signals : - order : \"<sentence> {{ arg_name }}\" - order : \"<sentence> {{ arg_name }} <sentence>\" - order : \"<sentence> {{ arg_name }} <sentence> {{ arg_name }}\" Example: signals : - order : \"I want to listen {{ artist_name }}\" - order : \"start the {{ episode_number }} episode\" - order : \"give me the weather at {{ location }} for {{ date }}\" Here, an example order would be speaking out loud the order: \"I want to listen Amy Winehouse\" In this example, both word \"Amy\" and \"Winehouse\" will be passed as an unique argument called artist_name to the neuron. If you want to send more than one argument, you must split your argument with a word that Kalliope will use to recognise the start and the end of each arguments. For example: \"give me the weather at {{ location }} for {{ date }}\" And the order would be: \"give me the weather at Paris for tomorrow\" And so, it will work too with: \"give me the weather at St-Pierre de Chartreuse for tomorrow\" See the input values section of the neuron documentation to know how to send arguments to a neuron. Important note: The following syntax cannot be used: \" {{ arg_name }} {{ arg_name2 }}\" as Kalliope cannot know when a block starts and when it finishes. stt-correction This option allow you to replace some words from the captured order by other word. Syntax: signals : - order : text : \"<sentence>\" stt-correction : - input : \"words to replace\" output : \"replacing words\" E.g - name : \"stt-correction-test\" signals : - order : text : \"this is my order\" stt-correction : - input : \"test\" output : \"order\" neurons : - debug : message : \"hello\" In this example, if you pronounce \"this is my test\", the word test will be translated into \"order\" and so the signal \"stt-correction-test\" would b triggered. This feature can be useful when working with numbers. For example, you know that your STT engine return all number as string and you need them as integer for your neurons. E.g: - name : \"mm-say\" signals : - order : text : \"this is my number {{ number }}\" stt-correction : - input : \"one\" output : 1 neurons : - debug : message : \"{{ number }}\" In this example, if you say \"this is my number one\", Kalliope will translate the word \"one\" into \"1\". stt-correction-file This option allow to set a list of corrections from a YAML file instead of writing them directly in the order. Syntax: signals : - order : text : \"<sentence>\" stt-correction-file : \"<path to yaml file>\" E.g - name : \"stt-correction-test\" signals : - order : text : \"this is my order\" stt-correction-file : \"my_stt_correction_file.yml\" neurons : - debug : message : \"hello\" Where my_stt_correction_file.yaml would looks like the following: - input : \"test\" output : \"order\" Use both stt-correction and stt-correction-file You can use both flag stt-correction and stt-correction-file in a synapse. This can be useful to set a correction file used as global file, and override input with stt-correction. Syntax: signals : - order : text : \"<sentence>\" stt-correction-file : \"<path to yaml file>\" stt-correction : - input : \"<sentence>\" output : \"<replacing sentence>\" For example, if you define a stt-correction-file with the content bellow: - input : \"bla\" output : \"this\" And a synapse like the following - name : \"stt-correction-test\" signals : - order : text : \"this is my order\" stt-correction-file : \"correction.yml\" stt-correction : - input : \"test\" output : \"order\" If you pronounce \"bla is my test\", both stt-correction-file and stt-correction will be used to fix the pronounced order, resulting \"this is my order\". Note: stt-correction has precedence over stt-correction-file . If an input is declared in stt-correction and in stt-correction-file , the output will be taken from the stt-correction option. Control from the Signal Neuron This signal can be updated on the fly from the Signals neuron . Skip the trigger Notification ID: \"skip_trigger\" Payload dict : parameter required default choices comment status YES TRUE, FALSE Set to True to skip the trigger Skip the trigger at the end of the synapse execution. Kalliope will listen for a new order directly without waiting for a trigger detection. The default flow of Kalliope is the following Me : \" Kalliope \" \u2192 hotword trigger \u2192 Me : \" do this \" \u2192 synapse launched \u2192 hotword trigger \u2192 Me : \" do that \" \u2192 synapse launched \u2192 \u2026 \" When switching the skip_trigger to True , the Kalliope workflow will be the following one until you switch back the skip_trigger to False : Me : \" Kalliope \" \u2192 hotword trigger \u2192 Me : \" do this \" \u2192 synapse launched \u2192 Me : \" do that \" \u2192 synapse launched \u2192 \u2026 \u2192 \" stop interactive trigger \" ( eg : Thanks kalliope ) Example synapses: Start skipping the trigger from a specific synapse - name : \"say-hello\" signals : - order : \"hello\" neurons : - say : message : \"hello sir\" - signals : notification : \"skip_trigger\" payload : status : \"True\" As we are escaping the trigger process, we need a synapse to break the loop. - name : \"stop-skip-trigger\" signals : - order : \"thanks kalliope\" neurons : - say : message : \"at your service\" - signals : notification : \"skip_trigger\" payload : status : \"False\" You can set it in a hook, so it will be activated after the first capture of the hotword from the trigger process. In this settings example, we will cal a synapse called start-skip-trigger on each trigger detection: hooks : on_start : \"on-start-synapse\" on_triggered : - \"on-triggered-synapse\" - \"start-skip-trigger\" The synapse in the brain looks like the following, of course we need to keep a stop-skip-trigger to be able to stop the loop anytime - name : \"start-skip-trigger\" signals : {} neurons : - signals : notification : \"skip_trigger\" payload : status : \"True\" - name : \"stop-skip-trigger\" signals : - order : \"thanks kalliope\" neurons : - say : message : \"at your service\" - signals : notification : \"skip_trigger\" payload : status : \"False\" Synapses example Normal order Syntax: signals : - order : \"<sentence>\" signals : - order : text : \"<sentence>\" matching-type : \"normal\" Example: signals : - order : \"please do this action\" signals : - order : text : \"please do this action\" matching-type : \"normal\" In this example, with a normal matching type, the synapse would be triggered if the user say: - please do this action - please do this action with more word - action this do please - action this do please with more word Strict order Syntax: signals : - order : text : \"<sentence>\" matching-type : \"strict\" Example: signals : - order : text : \"please do this action\" matching-type : \"strict\" In this example, with a strict matching type, the synapse would be triggered if the user say: - please do this action - action this do please Ordered strict order Syntax: signals : - order : text : \"<sentence>\" matching-type : \"ordered-strict\" Example: signals : - order : text : \"please do this action\" matching-type : \"ordered-strict\" In this example, with a strict matching type, the synapse would be triggered if the user say: - please do this action Notes Important note: SST engines can misunderstand what you say, or translate your sentence into text containing some spelling mistakes. For example, if you say \"Kalliope please do this\", the SST engine can return \"caliope please do this\". So, to be sure that your speaking order will be correctly caught and executed, we recommend you to test your STT engine by using the Kalliope GUI and check the returned text for the given order. Important note: STT engines don't know the context. Sometime they will return an unexpected word. For example, \"the operation to perform is 2 minus 2\" can return \"two\", \"too\", \"to\" or \"2\" in english. Important note: Kalliope will try to match the order in each synapse of its brain. So, if an order of one synapse is included in another order of another synapse, then both synapses tasks will be started by Kalliope. For example, you have \"test my umbrella\" in a synapse A and \"test\" in a synapse B. When you'll say \"test my umbrella\", both synapse A and B will be started by Kalliope. So keep in mind that the best practice is to use really different sentences with more than one word for your order.","title":"order"},{"location":"brain/signals/order/#input-parameters","text":"parameter required default choices comment order YES The order is passed directly without any parameters Other way to write an order, with parameters: parameter required default choices comment text YES The order to match matching-type NO normal normal, strict, ordered-strict, not-contain Type of matching.

In this settings example, we will cal a synapse called start-skip-trigger on each trigger detection: hooks : on_start : \"on-start-synapse\" on_triggered : - \"on-triggered-synapse\" - \"start-skip-trigger\" The synapse in the brain looks like the following, of course we need to keep a stop-skip-trigger to be able to stop the loop anytime - name : \"start-skip-trigger\" signals : {} neurons : - signals : notification : \"skip_trigger\" payload : status : \"True\" - name : \"stop-skip-trigger\" signals : - order : \"thanks kalliope\" neurons : - say : message : \"at your service\" - signals : notification : \"skip_trigger\" payload : status : \"False\"","title":"Skip the trigger"},{"location":"brain/signals/order/#synapses-example","text":"","title":"Synapses example"},{"location":"brain/signals/order/#normal-order","text":"Syntax: signals : - order : \"<sentence>\" signals : - order : text : \"<sentence>\" matching-type : \"normal\" Example: signals : - order : \"please do this action\" signals : - order : text : \"please do this action\" matching-type : \"normal\" In this example, with a normal matching type, the synapse would be triggered if the user say: - please do this action - please do this action with more word - action this do please - action this do please with more word","title":"Normal order"},{"location":"brain/signals/order/#strict-order","text":"Syntax: signals : - order : text : \"<sentence>\" matching-type : \"strict\" Example: signals : - order : text : \"please do this action\" matching-type : \"strict\" In this example, with a strict matching type, the synapse would be triggered if the user say: - please do this action - action this do please","title":"Strict order"},{"location":"brain/signals/order/#ordered-strict-order","text":"Syntax: signals : - order : text : \"<sentence>\" matching-type : \"ordered-strict\" Example: signals : - order : text : \"please do this action\" matching-type : \"ordered-strict\" In this example, with a strict matching type, the synapse would be triggered if the user say: - please do this action","title":"Ordered strict order"},{"location":"brain/signals/order/#notes","text":"Important note: SST engines can misunderstand what you say, or translate your sentence into text containing some spelling mistakes. For example, if you say \"Kalliope please do this\", the SST engine can return \"caliope please do this\". So, to be sure that your speaking order will be correctly caught and executed, we recommend you to test your STT engine by using the Kalliope GUI and check the returned text for the given order. Important note: STT engines don't know the context. Sometime they will return an unexpected word. For example, \"the operation to perform is 2 minus 2\" can return \"two\", \"too\", \"to\" or \"2\" in english. Important note: Kalliope will try to match the order in each synapse of its brain. So, if an order of one synapse is included in another order of another synapse, then both synapses tasks will be started by Kalliope. For example, you have \"test my umbrella\" in a synapse A and \"test\" in a synapse B. When you'll say \"test my umbrella\", both synapse A and B will be started by Kalliope. So keep in mind that the best practice is to use really different sentences with more than one word for your order.","title":"Notes"},{"location":"contribute/core/","text":"Contributing: core The community can contribute to the Core of Kalliope by providing some new features.

In this example, we don't need it and so we disable the gather_facts feature in order to win a couple seconds during the installation process.

The generated audio file is placed in cache until it is played by the audio player. Before generating a new audio file, Kalliope will take a look to the cache to load it directly without having to call the TSS engine if the file has been generated before. You must set a path where the cache will be saved in the tag cache_path . This one is placed in /tmp by default. cache_path : \"/tmp/kalliope_tts_cache\" Note: The path must be a valid path, and the current user must has enough right to read and write in it. Note: The consumed disk space can dramatically increase in the cache path folder. It is recommended to set your neuron correctly to clean up automatically generated audio files that will not be played more than once.

Name Type espeak Self hosted googletts Cloud based marytts Self hosted pico2wave Self hosted voicerss Cloud based watson Cloud based Hooks Hooking allow to bind actions to events based on the lifecycle of Kalliope. For example, it's useful to know when Kalliope has detected the hotword from the trigger engine and make her spell out loud that she's ready to listen your order. To use a hook, attach the name of the hook to a synapse (or list of synapse) which exists in your brain. Syntax: hooks : hook_name1 : synapse_name hook_name2 : - synapse_name_1 - synapse_name_2 E.g. hooks : on_start : \"on-start-synapse\" List of available hook Hook name Description on_start When kalliope is started. This hook will only be triggered once on_waiting_for_trigger When Kalliope waits for the hotword detection on_triggered When the hotword has been detected on_start_listening When the Speech to Text engine is listening for an order on_stop_listening When the Speech to Text engine stop listening for an order on_order_found When the pronounced order has been found in the brain on_order_not_found When the pronounced order has not been found in the brain on_processed_synapses When all neurons in synapses have been processed on_deaf When Kalliope switches from non deaf to deaf on_undeaf When Kalliope switches from deaf to non deaf on_mute When Kalliope switches from non mute to mute on_unmute When Kalliope switches from mute to non mute on_start_speaking When Kalliope starts speaking via the text to speech engine on_stop_speaking When Kalliope stops speaking on_stt_error When an error appeared during the STT processing Settings example Example: You want to hear a random answer when the hotword has been triggered settings.yml hooks : on_triggered : \"on-triggered-synapse\" brain.yml - name : \"on-triggered-synapse\" signals : [] neurons : - say : message : - \"yes sir?\" - \"I'm listening\" - \"I'm listening to you\" - \"sir?\" - \"what can i do for you?\" - \"Speaking\" - \"how can i help you?\" Example: You want to know that your order has not been found settings.yml hooks : on_order_not_found : \"order-not-found-synapse\" brain.yml - name : \"order-not-found-synapse\" signals : [] neurons : - say : message : - \"I haven't understood\" - \"I don't know this order\" - \"Please renew your order\" - \"Would you please reword your order\" - \"Can ou please reformulate your order\" - \"I don't recognize that order\" Example: You are running Kalliope on a Rpi. You've made a script that turn on or off a led. You can call this script every time kalliope start or stop speaking settings.yaml hooks : on_start_speaking : \"turn-on-led\" on_stop_speaking : \"turn-off-led\" brain.yml - name : \"turn-on-led\" signals : [] neurons : - script : path : \"/path/to/script.sh on\" - name : \"turn-off-led\" signals : [] neurons : - script : path : \"/path/to/script.sh off\" Note: You cannot use a neurotransmitter neuron inside a synapse called from a hook. You cannot use the \"say\" neuron inside the \"on_start_speaking\" or \"on_stop_speaking\" or it will create an infinite loop Rest API A Rest API can be activated in order to: List synapses Get synapse's detail Run a synapse Update settings Update the brain For the complete API ref see the REST API documentation Settings examples: rest_api : active : True port : 5000 password_protected : True login : admin password : secret allowed_cors_origin : \"*\" parameter type comment active boolean To enable the rest api server port integer TThe listening port of the web server. Must be an integer in range 1024-65535 password_protected boolean If True , the whole api will be password protected login string Login used by the basic HTTP authentication. Must be provided if password_protected is True password string Password used by the basic HTTP authentication. Must be provided if password_protected is True allowed_cors_origin string Allow request from external application. See examples bellow Cors request If you want to allow request from external application, you'll need to enable the CORS requests settings by defining authorized origins. To do so, just indicated the origins that are allowed to leverage the API. The authorize values are: False to forbid CORS request. allowed_cors_origin : False or either a string or a list: allowed_cors_origin : \"*\" (in case of \"*\", all origins are accepted). or allowed_cors_origin : - 'http://mydomain.com/*' - 'http://localhost:4200/*' Remember that an origin is composed of the scheme (http(s)), the port (eg: 80, 4200,\u2026) and the domain (mydomain.com, localhost). Resources directory The resources directory is the path where Kalliope will try to load community modules like Neurons, STTs or TTSs. Set a valid path is required if you want to install community neuron. The path can be relative or absolute. resource_directory : resource_name : \"path\" E.g resource_directory : neuron : \"resources/neurons\" stt : \"resources/stt\" tts : \"resources/tts\" trigger : \"/full/path/to/trigger\" Global Variables The Global Variables paths list where to load the global variables. Those variables can be reused in neuron parameters within double brackets. E.g var_files : - variables . yml - variables2 . yml Note: If a variable is defined in different files, the last file defines the value. In the files the variables are defined by key/value: variable : 60 baseURL : \"http://blabla.com/\" password : \"secret\" And use variables in your neurons: - name : \" run-simple-sleep \" signals : - order : \" Wait for me \" neurons : - uri : url : \" {{baseURL}}get/1 \" user : \" admin \" password : \" {{password}} \" Note: Because YAML format does no allow double braces not surrounded by quotes: you must use the variable between double quotes. A global variable can be a dictionary. Example: contacts : nico : \"1234\" tibo : \"5678\" And a synapse that use this dict: - name : \"test-var\" signals : - order : \"give me the number of {{ contact_to_search }}\" neurons : - say : message : - \"the number is {{ contacts[contact_to_search] }}\" Options Options that can be defined for Kalliope. Example config options : mute : True deaf : False Available options: Option Description mute When mute, the STT engine will not be used to make Kalliope talking during neurons execution deaf When deaf, the trigger engine is not started. Kalliope will not listen for a wake up word energy_threshold energy_threshold adjust_for_ambient_noise_second adjust_for_ambient_noise_second stt_timeout Number of seconds before stop the STT process automatically energy_threshold Represents the energy level threshold for sounds. By default set to 4000 . Values below this threshold are considered silence, and values above this threshold are considered speech. This is adjusted automatically if dynamic thresholds are enabled with adjust_for_ambient_noise_second parameter. This threshold is associated with the perceived loudness of the sound, but it is a nonlinear relationship. The actual energy threshold you will need depends on your microphone sensitivity or audio data. Typical values for a silent room are 0 to 100, and typical values for speaking are between 150 and 3500. Ambient (non-speaking) noise has a significant impact on what values will work best. If you're having trouble with the recognizer trying to recognize words even when you're not speaking, try tweaking this to a higher value. If you're having trouble with the recognizer not recognizing your words when you are speaking, try tweaking this to a lower value. For example, a sensitive microphone or microphones in louder rooms might have a ambient energy level of up to 4000. options : energy_threshold : 4000 Note: The default value is 4000 if not set adjust_for_ambient_noise_second If defined, will adjusts the energy threshold dynamically by capturing the current ambient noise of the room during the number of second set in the parameter. When set, the energy_threshold parameter is overridden by the returned value of the noise calibration. This value should be at least 0.5 in order to get a representative sample of the ambient noise. options : adjust_for_ambient_noise_second : 1 Note: The number of second here represents the time between kalliope's awakening and the moment when you can give her your order. send_anonymous_usage_stats This flag allow Kalliope to send some stats in order to anonymously evaluate the global usage of Kalliope app by users.

This one is placed in /tmp by default. cache_path : \"/tmp/kalliope_tts_cache\" Note: The path must be a valid path, and the current user must has enough right to read and write in it. Note: The consumed disk space can dramatically increase in the cache path folder. It is recommended to set your neuron correctly to clean up automatically generated audio files that will not be played more than once.","title":"cache_path"},{"location":"settings/settings/#settings-example_3","text":"default_text_to_speech : \"voicerss\" cache_path : \"/tmp/kalliope_tts_cache\" text_to_speech : - pico2wave : language : \"fr-FR\" cache : True - acapela : language : \"sonid15\" voice : \"Manon\" cache : False - googletts : language : \"fr\" - voicerss : language : \"fr-fr\" cache : True","title":"Settings example"},{"location":"settings/settings/#available-tts","text":"Core TTSs are already packaged with the installation of Kalliope an can be used out of the box.
