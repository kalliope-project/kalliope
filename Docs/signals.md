# Signals

A signal is an input event triggered by a synapse. When a signal is caught, Kalliope runs attached neurons of the synapse.

The syntax is the following
```yml
signals:
    - signal_type: parameter
```

Or
```yml
signals:
    - signal_type:
        parameter_key1: parameter_value1
        parameter_key2: parameter_value2
```
