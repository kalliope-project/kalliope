## Test your env

To ensure that you can record your voice, run the following command to capture audio input from your microphone:
```
rec test.wav
```

Press CTRL-C after capturing a sample of your voice.

Then play the recorded audio file
```
mplayer test.wav
```

You can then test your Kalliope is working by using the "bonjour" order integrated in the [default brain](../kalliope/brain.yml).
Start kalliope:
```
kalliope start
```

Kalliope will load default settings and brain, the output should looks the following
```
Starting event manager
Events loaded
Starting Kalliope
Press Ctrl+C for stopping
Starting REST API Listening port: 5000
```

Then speak the hotwork out loud to wake up Kalliope. By default, the hotwork is "Kalliop√©" with the french pronunciation.
If the trigger is successfully raised, you'll see "say something" into the console. 
```

Say something!
```

Then you can say "bonjour" and listen the Kalliope response.
```
Say something!
Google Speech Recognition thinks you said Bonjour
Order matched in the brain. Running synapse "say-hello-fr"
Waiting for trigger detection
```

## Next: Create you own bot
If everything is ok, you can start playing with Kalliope. First, take a look to the [default settings](settings.md).
