# Dev environment installation

This documentation aims at explaining step by step manual deployment of Kalliope.

Tested env
- Ubuntu 16.04
- Raspbian Jessie 



## Prerequisites

### Packages installation
To make Kalliope work, you will have to install a certain number of libraries

On Ubuntu distribution :
```
sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev libsmpeg0 libttspico-utils libsmpeg0 flac dialog libffi-dev libffi-dev libssl-dev portaudio19-dev build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev sox libatlas3-base mplayer
```

### Test your env
Run the following command to capture audio from your microphone
```
rec test.wav
```

Then play the recorded audio file
```
play test.wav
```

## Installation

### Get the sources
Clone the project
```
git clone https://github.com/kalliope-project/kalliope.git
```

### Python lib

Install libs
```
sudo pip install -r install/files/python_requirements.txt
```

If you are running kalliope on a Raspberry Pi, you must perform some other step by [following the dedicated documentation](RPi.md).
