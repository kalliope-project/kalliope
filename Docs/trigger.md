# Triggers

With Kalliope project, you can set whatever Hotword you want to wake it up. 


# Snowboy

You can create your magic word by connecting to [Snowboy](https://snowboy.kitt.ai/) and then download the trained model file.

Once downloaded:
- place the file in your personal config folder.
- update the path of **pmdl_file** in [your settings](settings.md).

If you want to keep "Kalliope" as the name of your bot, we recommend you to __enhance the existing Snowboy model for your language__.

We will update the following list with all Kalliope model created by the community. If the model doesn't exist, please create one with the following syntax:
```
kalliope-<language_code>
```

E.g
```
kalliope-FR
kalliope-EN
kalliope-RU
kalliope-DE
```
Then, open an issue or create a pull request to add the model to the list bellow.
