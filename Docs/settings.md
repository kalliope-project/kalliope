# Kalliope settings

This part of the documentation explains the main configuration of Kalliope placed in the `settings.md` file.

## Triggers configuration

### default_trigger

The trigger is the module detecting the hotword that will wake up Kalliope.
Common usage of hotword include Alexa on Amazon Echo, OK Google on some Android devices and Hey Siri on iPhones.

Specify the name of the trigger module you want to use.
```yml
default_trigger: "trigger_name"
```

Available triggers for Kalliope are:
- snowboy

### triggers
The hotword (also called a wake word or trigger word) detector is the engine in charge of waking up Kalliope.

Each Trigger has it own configuration. This configuration is passed as argument following the syntax bellow
```yml
triggers:
  - trigger_name:
      parameter_name: "value"
```

E.g, the default Snowboy trigger configuration is
```yml
triggers:
  - snowboy:
      pmdl_file: "trigger/snowboy/resources/model.pmdl"
```

See the complete list of [available triggers here](trigger.md).

## Players configuration

### default_player

The player is the module managing the sound in Kalliope.

Specify the name of the player module you want to use.
```yml
default_player: "player_name"
```
E.g
```yml
default_player: "mplayer"
```

### players
The player is the engine in charge of running sounds in Kalliope.

Each Players has it own configuration. 
This configuration is passed as argument following the syntax bellow
```yml
players:
  - player_name:
      parameter_name: "value"
```

E.g
```yml
players:
  - mplayer: {}
  - pyalsaaudio:
     device: "default"
     convert_to_wav: True
  - pyaudioplayer:
     convert_to_wav: True
  - sounddeviceplayer:
     convert_to_wav: True
```

See the complete list of [available players here](player_list.md).

When no parameters are required set an empty object:
```yml
players:
  - mplayer: {}
```

Sometime, parameters will be necessary to use an engine. See the [complete list here](player_list.md) to know which parameter are required.
Core players are already packaged with the installation of Kalliope an can be used out of the box. 

>**Note:** Most cloud based TTS generate a file in MP3 format. Some players are not able to read this format and then a conversion to wav is needed.


## Speech to text configuration

### default_speech_to_text

A Speech To Text(STT) is an engine used to translate what you say into a text that can be processed by Kalliope core.
By default, Kalliope uses google STT engine.

The following syntax is used to provide the engine name:
```yml
default_speech_to_text: "stt_name"
```

E.g
```yml
default_speech_to_text: "google"
```

Get the full list of [SST engine here](stt.md).

### speech_to_text
Each STT has it own configuration. This configuration is passed as argument as shown bellow
```yml
speech_to_text:
  - stt_name:
      parameter_name: "value"
```

E.g:
```yml
speech_to_text:
  - google:
      language: "fr-FR"
  - bing
```

Some arguments are required, some others are optional, please refer to the [STT documentation](stt.md) to know available parameters for each supported STT.

### recognition_options

Represents a collection of speech recognition settings and functionality.
```yml
recognition_options:
  option_name: option_value
  option_name2: option_value2
```

E.g
```yml
recognition_options:
  energy_threshold: 3000
```

#### energy_threshold

Represents the energy level threshold for sounds. By default set to **4000**.
Values below this threshold are considered silence, and values above this threshold are considered speech.
This is adjusted automatically if dynamic thresholds are enabled with `adjust_for_ambient_noise_second` parameter.

This threshold is associated with the perceived loudness of the sound, but it is a nonlinear relationship. 
The actual energy threshold you will need depends on your microphone sensitivity or audio data. 
Typical values for a silent room are 0 to 100, and typical values for speaking are between 150 and 3500. 
Ambient (non-speaking) noise has a significant impact on what values will work best.

If you're having trouble with the recognizer trying to recognize words even when you're not speaking, try tweaking this to a higher value. 
If you're having trouble with the recognizer not recognizing your words when you are speaking, try tweaking this to a lower value. 
For example, a sensitive microphone or microphones in louder rooms might have a ambient energy level of up to 4000.
```yml
recognition_options:
  energy_threshold: 4000
```

>**Note:** The default value is 4000 if not set

#### adjust_for_ambient_noise_second

If defined, will adjusts the energy threshold dynamically by capturing the current ambient noise of the room during the number of second set in the parameter.
When set, the `energy_threshold` parameter is overridden by the returned value of the noise calibration.
This value should be at least 0.5 in order to get a representative sample of the ambient noise.

```yml
recognition_options:
  adjust_for_ambient_noise_second: 1
```

>**Note:** The number of second here represents the time between kalliope's awakening and the moment when you can give her your order.

## Text to speech configuration

### default_text_to_speech
A Text To Speech is an engine used to translate written text into a speech, into an audio stream.
By default, Kalliope use Pico2wave TTS engine.

The following syntax is used to provide the TTS engine name
```yml
default_text_to_speech: "tts_name"
```

Eg
```yml
default_text_to_speech: "pico2wave"
```

Get the full list of [TTS engine here](tts.md).

### text_to_speech
Each TTS has it own configuration. This configuration is passed as argument following the syntax bellow
```yml
text_to_speech:
  - tts_name:
      parameter_name: "value"
```

E.g
```yml
text_to_speech:
  - pico2wave:
      language: "fr-FR"
  - googletts:
      language: "fr"
```

Some arguments are required, some other optional, please refer to the [TTS documentation](tts.md) to know available parameters for each supported TTS.

## Hooks

Hooking allow to bind actions to events based on the lifecycle of Kalliope. 
For example, it's useful to know yen Kalliope has detected the hotword from the trigger engine and make her spell out loud that she's ready to listen your order.

To use a hook, attach the name of the hook to a synapse (or list of synapse) which exist in your brain.

Syntax:
```yml
hooks:
  hook_name1: synapse_name
  hook_name2:
    - synapse_name_1
    - synapse_name_2
```

E.g.
```yml
hooks:
  on_start: "on-start-synapse"
```

List of available hook

| Hook name              | Description                                                     |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| on_start               | When kalliope is started. This hook will only be triggered once |
| on_waiting_for_trigger | When Kalliope wait for the hotword detection                    |
| on_triggered           | When the hotword has been detected                              |
| on_start_listening     | When the Speech to Text engine is listening for an order        |
| on_stop_listening      | When the Speech to Text engine stop listening for an order      |
| on_order_found         | When the pronounced order has been found in the brain           |
| on_order_not_found     | When the pronounced order has not been found in the brain       |
| on_mute                | When Kalliope switch from non muted to muted                    |
| on_unmute              | When Kalliope switch from muted to non muted                    |
| on_start_speaking      | When Kalliope start speaking via the text to speech engine      |
| on_stop_speaking       | When Kalliope stop speaking                                     |

Example: You want to hear a random answer when the hotword has been triggered

**settings.yml**
```yml
hooks:
  on_triggered: "on-triggered-synapse"
```

**brain.yml**
```yml
- name: "on-triggered-synapse"
  signals: []
  neurons:
    - say:
        message:
          - "yes sir?"
          - "I'm listening"
          - "I'm listening to you"
          - "sir?"
          - "what can i do for you?"
          - "Speaking"
          - "how can i help you?"
```

Example: You want to know that your order has not been found

**settings.yml**
```yml
hooks:
  on_order_not_found: "order-not-found-synapse"
```

**brain.yml**
```yml
- name: "order-not-found-synapse"
    signals: []
    neurons:
      - say:
          message:
            - "I haven't understood"
            - "I don't know this order"
            - "Please renew your order"
            - "Would you please reword your order"
            - "Can ou please reformulate your order"
            - "I don't recognize that order"
```

Example: You are running Kalliope on a Rpi. You've made a script that turn on or off a led.
You can call this script every time kalliope start or stop speaking

**settings.yml**
```yml
hooks:
  on_start_speaking: "turn-on-led"
  on_stop_speaking: "turn-off-led"
```

**brain.yml**
```yml
- name: "turn-on-led"
  signals: []   
  neurons:
    - script:
        path: "/path/to/script.sh on" 
        
- name: "turn-off-led"
  signals: []   
  neurons:
    - script:
        path: "/path/to/script.sh off"  
```

## Rest API

A Rest API can be activated in order to:
- List synapses
- Get synapse's detail
- Run a synapse

For the complete API ref see the [REST API documentation](rest_api.md)

Settings examples:
```yml
rest_api:
  active: True
  port: 5000
  password_protected: True
  login: admin
  password: secret
  allowed_cors_origin: "*"
```

### active
To enable the rest api server.

### port
The listening port of the web server. Must be an integer in range 1024-65535.

### password_protected
If `True`, the whole api will be password protected.

#### Login
Login used by the basic HTTP authentication. Must be provided if `password_protected` is `True`

### Password
Password used by the basic HTTP authentication. Must be provided if `password_protected` is `True`

### Cors request
If you want to allow request from external application, you'll need to enable the CORS requests settings by defining authorized origins.
To do so, just indicated the origins that are allowed to leverage the API. The authorize values are:

False to forbid CORS request.
```yml
allowed_cors_origin: False
```

or either a string or a list:
```yml
allowed_cors_origin: "*"
```
(in case of "*", all origins are accepted).
or
```yml
allowed_cors_origin:
  - 'http://mydomain.com/*'
  - 'http://localhost:4200/*'
```

Remember that an origin is composed of the scheme (http(s)), the port (eg: 80, 4200,…) and the domain (mydomain.com, localhost).

## Default synapse

Run a default [synapse](brain.md) when Kalliope can't find the order in any synapse or if the SST engine haven't understood the order.

```yml
default_synapse: "synapse-name"
```

E.g
```yml
default_synapse: "Default-response"
```

## Resources directory

The resources directory is the path where Kalliope will try to load community modules like Neurons, STTs or TTSs.
Set a valid path is required if you want to install community neuron. The path can be relative or absolute.

```yml
resource_directory:
  resource_name: "path"
```

E.g
```yml
resource_directory:
  neuron: "resources/neurons"
  stt: "resources/stt"
  tts: "resources/tts"
  trigger: "/full/path/to/trigger"
```


## Global Variables

The Global Variables paths list where to load the global variables.
Those variables can be reused in neuron parameters within double brackets.

E.g 
```yml
var_files:
  - variables.yml
  - variables2.yml
```
> **Note:** If a variable is defined in different files, the last file defines the value.

In the files the variables are defined by key/value:
```yml
variable: 60
baseURL: "http://blabla.com/"
password: "secret"
```

And use variables in your neurons:
```yml
  - name: "run-simple-sleep"
    signals:
      - order: "Wait for me "
    neurons:
      - uri:
          url: "{{baseURL}}get/1"        
          user: "admin"
          password: "{{password}}"
```

> **Note:** Because YAML format does no allow double braces not surrounded by quotes: you must use the variable between double quotes. 

A global variable can be a dictionary. Example:
```yml
contacts:
  nico: "1234"
  tibo: "5678"
```

And a synapse that use this dict:
```yml
- name: "test-var"
  signals:
    - order: "give me the number of {{ contact_to_search }}"
  neurons:
    - say:
        message:
        - "the number is {{ contacts[contact_to_search] }}"
```

## Start options
Options that can be defined when kalliope starts.

Example config
```yaml
start_options:
  muted: True
```

## Next: configure the brain of Kalliope
Now your settings are ok, you can start creating the [brain](brain.md) of your assistant.
